i'm a mechanical engineer who realized most software is needlessly complex. we've built layers of abstraction that mostly serve to obscure what's actually happening and make simple things difficult.

my focus is on systems that do real work - graphics engines, automation tools, data pipelines. things that produce tangible output rather than shuffling abstractions around.

the current software industry is full of cargo-culted practices and performative complexity. daily standups, sprint planning, story points - most of this is theatre that gets in the way of actual work.
