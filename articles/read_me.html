					i'm a mechanical engineer who realized most software is needlessly

					my focus is on systems that do real work - graphics engines,

					the current software industry is full of cargo-culted practices and

					i'm interested in the reality of what computers can do. not buzzwords,

					if this resonates with you, let's talk about your project. i charge
